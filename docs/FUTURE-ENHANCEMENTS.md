## High Priority Enhancements

### 1. ✅ [FIXED] Optimized Docker Builds for Frontend & Backend
**Status:** ✅ **Completed** (November 19, 2025)  
**Priority:** High  
**Impact:** Achieved a **~70-80% reduction** in Docker build times for both frontend and backend applications, significantly speeding up the CI/CD pipeline. Build times were reduced from over 2.5 minutes to under 40 seconds.

#### **Problem Summary:**
The Docker image build process for both frontend and backend applications was slow and inefficient, taking several minutes to complete. This was primarily due to a lack of caching for dependencies (`node_modules`) and large, unoptimized build contexts.

#### **Solution Implemented:**
A series of optimizations were applied to the `Dockerfile` and build process for both applications, transforming them into efficient, secure, and fast multi-stage builds.

**Key Optimizations Applied:**

1.  **Multi-Stage Builds:**
    *   A `builder` stage was introduced to compile/build the application and install all dependencies.
    *   A lean final `production` stage copies only the necessary build artifacts and production `node_modules`, resulting in smaller and more secure final images.

2.  **BuildKit Cache Mounts:**
    *   The `npm` cache directory was mounted during the build using `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm`.
    *   This allows `npm install` or `npm ci` to reuse cached packages across builds, dramatically reducing dependency installation time.

3.  **.dockerignore Files:**
    *   Comprehensive `.dockerignore` files were added for both frontend and backend to exclude unnecessary files and directories (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `.vscode`, markdown files) from the Docker build context. This reduces the context size and prevents unnecessary cache invalidation.

4.  **Backend-Specific Enhancements:**
    *   **Alpine Base Image:** Switched to `node:18-alpine` for the final stage, a much smaller and more secure base image.
    *   **Non-Root User:** A dedicated `appuser` was created and is used to run the application, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Production Dependencies Only:** Used `npm ci --omit=dev` to ensure only production dependencies are installed in the final image.

**Outcome:**
These changes have made the Docker build process significantly faster and more robust. The smaller final images also improve security and reduce storage costs in the container registry (ECR).

**Detailed Fix Documentation:** See [fixes/JENKINS-PERFORMANCE-FIX.md](./fixes/JENKINS-PERFORMANCE-FIX.md) for complete troubleshooting steps and implementation details.

### 2. ✅ [FIXED] ArgoCD Image Auto-Deployment for Backend
**Status:** ✅ **Completed** (November 18, 2025)  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Impact:** Unblocked the entire CI/CD pipeline for the backend application, enabling fully automated, zero-touch deployments.

#### **Problem Summary:**
The backend application was not automatically deploying new images despite the CI pipeline successfully building and pushing them to ECR. The ArgoCD Image Updater logs showed it was detecting the new image tags (e.g., `61`, `62`, `63`), but the live `Deployment` in the Kubernetes cluster remained stuck on an old tag (e.g., `52`).

#### **Root Cause Analysis & Resolution:**

The issue was caused by a combination of two factors that created a deadlock:

1.  **Failing Health Probes:** The primary issue was that newer versions of the backend application were taking longer to start up. This caused them to fail their `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe`. When Kubernetes tried to perform a rolling update, the new pods never became "Ready," causing Kubernetes to halt the update to prevent downtime, leaving the old, stable pods running.

2.  **Incorrect ArgoCD `ignoreDifferences` Configuration:** A secondary, critical misconfiguration was found in the `argocd-apps/backend-app.yaml`. The `Application` was configured to ignore changes to the `image` field of the deployment:
    ```yaml
    ignoreDifferences:
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
      jsonPointers:
      - /spec/template/spec/containers/0/image
    ```
    This setting told Argo CD to consider the application as `Synced` even when the desired image tag in its spec was different from the live image tag in the cluster. As a result, Argo CD never initiated an automatic sync to correct the difference.

#### **Solution Steps:**

1.  **Removed `ignoreDifferences`:** The `ignoreDifferences` block was removed from `argocd-apps/backend-app.yaml`. This allowed Argo CD to correctly identify when the live deployment's image was out of date and automatically trigger a sync.

2.  **Adjusted Health Probe Timings:** The probes in `Kubernetes-Manifests-file/Backend/deployment.yaml` were re-enabled but with more generous `initialDelaySeconds` to give the application sufficient time to initialize before being checked.
    *   **startupProbe:** `initialDelaySeconds` set to `30`.
    *   **readinessProbe:** `initialDelaySeconds` set to `20`.
    *   **livenessProbe:** `initialDelaySeconds` set to `15`.

**Outcome:**
With these two fixes, the end-to-end continuous deployment workflow for the backend is now fully functional and robust. New images pushed to ECR are automatically detected and safely rolled out with proper health checking.

**Detailed Fix Documentation:** See [fixes/INFRASTRUCTURE-OPTIMIZATION-AND-FIXES.md](./fixes/INFRASTRUCTURE-OPTIMIZATION-AND-FIXES.md) for complete troubleshooting steps and probe configuration details.

### 3. ✅ [COMPLETED] HTTPS Implementation with Custom Domain
**Status:** ✅ **Completed** (November 26, 2025)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Impact:** Successfully secured application with HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager and custom domain `todo.tarang.cloud`, enabling encrypted traffic and production-ready deployment.

#### **Implementation Completed:**
Successfully implemented end-to-end HTTPS encryption with custom domain, ACM certificate, and proper frontend-backend communication.

**Certificate Details:**
- Domain: `*.tarang.cloud` (wildcard)
- Certificate ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:296062548155:certificate/d96a5918-4b5a-4c40-981a-f78468a3d3d8`
- Validation: DNS (Hostinger)
- Status: Issued & Active

**Ingress Configuration:**
```yaml
annotations:
  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP": 80}, {"HTTPS": 443}]'
  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: '443'
  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:296062548155:certificate/d96a5918-4b5a-4c40-981a-f78468a3d3d8
spec:
  rules:
  - host: todo.tarang.cloud
```

**Frontend API Configuration:**
```yaml
env:
- name: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
  value: "https://todo.tarang.cloud/api/tasks"
```

#### **Request Flow Architecture:**

```
User (Browser)
    ↓ HTTPS (Port 443)
https://todo.tarang.cloud (DNS CNAME)
    ↓ SSL/TLS Termination
AWS ALB (ACM Certificate: *.tarang.cloud)
    ↓ HTTP→HTTPS Redirect (Port 80→443)
Ingress Controller (Host: todo.tarang.cloud)
    ↓ Path-Based Routing
    ├─ / → Frontend Service (Port 80)
    │        ↓ HTTPS API Call
    │        https://todo.tarang.cloud/api/tasks
    │        ↓
    └─ /api → Backend Service (Port 3500)
               ↓ MongoDB Connection
               MongoDB Service (Port 27017)
               ↓ Persistent Storage
               MongoDB StatefulSet (PVC)
```

#### **Challenges Resolved:**
1. **CAA Record Issues:** Added `issuewild "amazon.com"` for wildcard certificate support
2. **DNS Validation:** Fixed CNAME format for Hostinger (prefix-only, no domain)
3. **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Updated REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to use HTTPS domain
4. **Mixed Content Errors:** Ensured all API calls use HTTPS protocol

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Full HTTPS encryption end-to-end
- ✅ Custom domain with professional branding
- ✅ Automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect
- ✅ Valid SSL certificate (browser shows 🔒 padlock)
- ✅ Frontend-Backend communication over HTTPS
- ✅ Production-ready secure application

**Live Application:** https://todo.tarang.cloud

### 4. 🔐 User Session Management & Data Isolation
**Status:** 🚀 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** High  
**Timeline:** Q2 2026  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

#### **Current Issue:**
The application currently **does not have user session management**. All users share the same MongoDB collection, resulting in:
- ❌ **No user isolation:** Everyone sees the same tasks
- ❌ **No privacy:** Tasks created on mobile appear on web and vice versa
- ❌ **No authentication:** Anyone can add/delete any task
- ❌ **No multi-tenancy:** Cannot distinguish between different users

#### **Observed Behavior:**
- Accessing `https://todo.tarang.cloud` on mobile phone shows **exact same data** as web browser
- Changes made on mobile **immediately reflect** on web (and vice versa)
- No login/logout functionality
- All users operate on a single global task list

#### **Proposed Solution:**

**Phase 1: User Authentication (4-6 hours)**

1. **Backend: Add User Schema & JWT Auth**
```javascript
// User Schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }, // bcrypt hashed
  name: String,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

// Task Schema with user reference
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  completed: Boolean,
  userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }, // NEW
  createdAt: Date
});

// Authentication Middleware
const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.userId = decoded.userId;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};

// User-Scoped Task Queries
app.get('/api/tasks', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  const tasks = await Task.find({ userId: req.userId });
  res.json(tasks);
});

app.post('/api/tasks', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  const task = new Task({
    ...req.body,
    userId: req.userId
  });
  await task.save();
  res.json(task);
});
```

2. **Frontend: Add Login/Registration UI**
- Login page component
- Registration form
- JWT token storage (localStorage)
- Protected routes
- Authentication state management (Context/Redux)

**Phase 2: Data Isolation (2-3 hours)**

- All API calls include JWT token in Authorization header
- Backend filters all queries by `userId` from JWT
- Each user sees only their own tasks
- Logout functionality (clear token)

**Phase 3: Security Enhancements (2-3 hours)**

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting (prevent brute force)
- Refresh tokens for session management
- Password reset functionality
- Input validation & sanitization

#### **Architecture Changes:**

**Before (Current):**
```
Browser 1 → API → MongoDB (Single Collection: tasks)
Browser 2 → API → MongoDB (Same Collection)
Mobile   → API → MongoDB (Same Collection)
❌ All users see all tasks
```

**After (With Sessions):**
```
Browser 1 (User A) → JWT → API → MongoDB (tasks WHERE userId='A')
Browser 2 (User B) → JWT → API → MongoDB (tasks WHERE userId='B')
Mobile   (User A) → JWT → API → MongoDB (tasks WHERE userId='A')
✅ Each user sees only their own tasks
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ User privacy and data isolation
- ✅ True multi-tenant application
- ✅ Production-ready authentication
- ✅ Portfolio demonstrates full-stack auth
- ✅ Security best practices (JWT, bcrypt, HTTPS)

**Technical Stack:**
- Backend: JWT (jsonwebtoken), bcrypt, express-validator
- Frontend: React Context/Redux, protected routes
- Database: MongoDB user collection + userId foreign key
- Security: HTTPS (✅ done), CORS, rate limiting

**Cost Impact:** None (no additional AWS resources)

### 5. 📦 Separate Backend and Frontend Repositories (Phased Approach)
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 & Phase 2 Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Completion Date:** November 20, 2025  

**Description:**
Successfully transitioned from a monorepo to a true microservices architecture by separating the frontend and backend applications into their own dedicated repositories. This phased approach minimized risk and validated each step. The primary goal achieved: code changes in one service only trigger its own CI/CD pipeline, enabling true independent development and deployment.

---
#### **Phase 1: Decouple Frontend Application** ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 20, 2025)

**Goal:** Move the frontend application to its own repository and ensure its CI/CD pipeline and deployment work independently, without affecting or being affected by the backend.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  ✅ **Created New `three-tier-fe` Repository:** New dedicated repository created at `https://github.com/uditmishra03/three-tier-fe.git`
2.  ✅ **Migrated Frontend Code:** Complete migration of `Application-Code/frontend` to new repository including:
    - All frontend source code (`src/`, `public/`)
    - Dockerfile and Docker configuration
    - nginx configuration
    - package.json and dependencies
3.  ✅ **Created Standalone Frontend Pipeline:**
    - Moved and adapted Jenkinsfile to new repository root
    - Configured Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline job: `MBP_Three-Tier-fe_MBP`
    - Set up GitHub webhook with token: `frontend-webhook-token`
    - Fixed pipeline issues (removed redundant git checkout, corrected paths)
    - Implemented workspace cleanup in `post` block
4.  ✅ **Implemented Date-Based Image Tagging:**
    - Changed from sequential BUILD_NUMBER to semantic date-based tags
    - Format: `YYYYMMDD-BUILD` (e.g., `20241120-5`)
    - Benefits: Human-readable, scalable, always increasing
    - More professional than epoch timestamps
5.  ✅ **Updated ArgoCD Configuration:**
    - Updated `argocd-apps/frontend-app.yaml` to point to new repository
    - Changed `targetRevision` from `HEAD` to `master` branch
    - Fixed image tag regex from `^[0-9]+$` to `^[0-9-]+$` to support date-based format
    - Verified ArgoCD Image Updater successfully detects and deploys new images
6.  ✅ **Verified End-to-End Flow:**
    - Tested complete CI/CD pipeline: code push → Jenkins build → ECR push → ArgoCD deployment
    - Successfully deployed image `frontend:20241119-5` from new repository
    - Confirmed frontend changes don't trigger backend pipeline (true decoupling)
7.  ✅ **Enhanced UI Design:**
    - Modernized frontend with minimalistic, appealing design
    - Implemented purple gradient theme and glass-morphism effects
    - Added custom checkbox styling and smooth animations
    - Improved mobile responsiveness
8.  ✅ **Cleaned Up Monorepo:**
    - Removed `Application-Code/frontend/` directory (17 files)
    - Removed `Kubernetes-Manifests-file/Frontend/` manifests (2 files)
    - Removed old Jenkinsfiles: `jenkinsfile_frontend_mbp`, `Jenkinsfile-Frontend`
    - Total cleanup: 21 files removed from main repository
    - Committed with: "chore: Remove frontend code after migration to three-tier-fe repository"

**Key Achievements:**
- 🎯 **True Microservices Architecture:** Frontend now has completely independent CI/CD pipeline
- 🚀 **Improved Developer Experience:** Frontend developers can work without affecting backend
- 📊 **Better Tagging Strategy:** Date-based tags are readable and scalable
- 🎨 **Enhanced UI:** Modern, professional frontend design
- ✅ **Zero Downtime Migration:** Seamless transition with no service interruption
- 📦 **Cleaner Repository Structure:** Main repo no longer cluttered with frontend code

**Lessons Learned:**
- ArgoCD Image Updater requires careful regex configuration for custom tag formats
- Multibranch Pipelines auto-checkout, so explicit git checkout stage is redundant
- `cleanWs()` in post block is better practice than at pipeline start
- Date-based tagging (YYYYMMDD-BUILD) provides better balance than pure epoch timestamps

    - Fixed Docker build to work from repository root
    - Standardized platform to `linux/amd64` only (removed multi-platform complexity)
    - Applied date-based tagging (YYYYMMDD-BUILD format)
4.  ✅ **Restructured Kubernetes Manifests:**
    - Moved manifests from nested `Kubernetes-Manifests-file/Backend/` to root `manifests/` directory
    - Created clean structure: `manifests/deployment.yaml`, `manifests/service.yaml`, `manifests/kustomization.yaml`
    - Replicated same structure in frontend repo for consistency
    - Both microservices now follow identical manifest organization
5.  ✅ **Updated ArgoCD Configuration:**
    - Modified `argocd-apps/backend-app.yaml` to point to `three-tier-be` repository
    - Updated path from `Kubernetes-Manifests-file/Backend` to `manifests/`
    - Changed `targetRevision` to `master` branch
    - Fixed allow-tags regex to `^[0-9-]+$` for date-based format support
6.  ✅ **Created ArgoCD Apps for Shared Infrastructure:**

- ✅ **Consistent Manifest Structure:** Both microservices use identical `manifests/` layout
- 📊 **Professional Repository Naming:** Clear, intuitive naming convention for all repos
- 🔄 **GitOps Best Practices:** All infrastructure changes tracked in git with ArgoCD sync

**Lessons Learned:**
- Jenkinsfile `dir()` wrappers must be removed when migrating to repository root
- Shared infrastructure (database, ingress) should remain in central infrastructure repo
- Consistent manifest directory structure improves maintainability across microservices
- Directory naming matters: `k8s-infrastructure` is clearer than `Kubernetes-Manifests-file`
- ArgoCD applications work well for managing both microservices and shared resources

---
#### **Phase 3: Infrastructure Validation Pipeline** ✅ **COMPLETED** (November 20, 2025)

**Goal:** Create automated validation pipeline for infrastructure repository to ensure code quality, syntax correctness, and security compliance for all IaC and configuration changes.

**Problem:** Infrastructure repository contains critical Terraform code, Kubernetes manifests, ArgoCD configurations, and shell scripts that need validation before deployment. Without automated checks, syntax errors or security issues could reach production.

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1.  ✅ **Created Infrastructure Jenkinsfile:** New `Jenkinsfile` at repository root for Infrastructure-Validation-MBP
2.  ✅ **Configured Jenkins Terraform Plugin:** Installed and configured Terraform tool in Jenkins Global Tool Configuration
3.  ✅ **Implemented Consolidated Validation Stages:**
    - **Checkout Stage:** Clones infrastructure repository
    - **Terraform Validation:** 
      - Runs `terraform fmt -check -recursive` for formatting validation
      - Executes `terraform init -backend=false` and `terraform validate` for syntax checking
      - Validates all `.tf` files in `Jenkins-Server-TF/` directory
    - **YAML & Scripts Validation:** (Consolidated from 4 separate stages)
      - Kubernetes manifests validation with `kubeconform` tool
      - ArgoCD application definitions validation with Python YAML parser
      - ArgoCD Image Updater config validation
      - Shell script syntax checking with `bash -n`
    - **Security Scan:** 
      - Trivy IaC security scanning for HIGH and CRITICAL issues
      - Scans both Terraform code and Kubernetes manifests
    - **Validation Summary:** Final status report with all checks
4.  ✅ **Optimized Pipeline Structure:**
    - Reduced from 9 stages to 5 stages for better clarity and performance
    - Removed Documentation Check stage (not needed for pipeline validation)
    - Combined logically similar validations into single stages
    - All tools install without sudo requirements (local binaries)
5.  ✅ **Tool Installation Strategy:**
    - **kubeconform:** Downloads and uses local binary (`./kubeconform`)
    - **Terraform:** Managed via Jenkins plugin with auto-installation
    - **Python YAML:** Uses existing Python 3 on Jenkins agent
    - **Trivy:** Uses pre-installed Trivy at `/usr/bin/trivy`
    - No sudo permissions required for any tool
6.  ✅ **ArgoCD-Specific Validation:**
    - Switched from kubeconform to Python's `yaml.safe_load` for ArgoCD files
    - Reason: kubeconform doesn't have ArgoCD CRD schemas by default
    - Validates YAML syntax without requiring schema definitions
7.  ✅ **Created Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline:**
    - Job name: `Infrastructure-Validation-MBP`
    - Configured branch discovery for all branches
    - Set up periodic scanning (1 hour intervals)
    - Connected to infrastructure repository with GitHub credentials

**Pipeline Validation Coverage:**
| Validation Type | Tool Used | Files Validated |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Terraform Syntax | terraform fmt, validate | `Jenkins-Server-TF/*.tf` |
| K8s Manifests | kubeconform | `k8s-infrastructure/**/*.yaml` |
| ArgoCD Apps | Python yaml | `argocd-apps/*.yaml` |
| ArgoCD Image Updater | Python yaml | `argocd-image-updater-config/*.yaml` |
| Shell Scripts | bash -n | `**/*.sh` |
| IaC Security | Trivy | Terraform + K8s files |

**Key Achievements:**
- 🎯 **Automated Infrastructure Validation:** Every PR and commit validated automatically
- 🚀 **No Manual Checks Required:** Pipeline catches errors before they reach production
- 🔒 **Security Integration:** Trivy scans detect vulnerabilities in IaC
- 📊 **Consolidated Stages:** Cleaner pipeline with logical grouping (5 stages vs 9)
- ✅ **Zero Sudo Dependencies:** All tools run without elevated permissions
- 🏗️ **3-Pipeline Architecture:** Complete CI/CD coverage
  - Frontend MBP: Builds and pushes frontend images
  - Backend MBP: Builds and pushes backend images
  - Infrastructure MBP: Validates IaC, manifests, and scripts

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Catches Terraform syntax errors before apply
- ✅ Validates Kubernetes manifest schema correctness
- ✅ Ensures ArgoCD configurations are valid YAML
- ✅ Detects shell script syntax issues early
- ✅ Identifies security vulnerabilities in infrastructure code
- ✅ Provides fast feedback loop (validation completes in < 2 minutes)

**Pipeline Stages Summary:**
```
1. Checkout          → Clone repository
2. Terraform         → Validate .tf files (fmt + validate)
3. YAML & Scripts    → Validate K8s, ArgoCD, shell scripts
4. Security Scan     → Trivy IaC scanning
5. Summary           → Display validation results
```

```

**Three Jenkins Pipelines:**
1. **Frontend-MBP** (`three-tier-fe`)
   - SonarQube analysis → Trivy scan → Docker build → ECR push
   - Date-based image tags (YYYYMMDD-BUILD)
   - ArgoCD Image Updater auto-deploys new images

2. **Backend-MBP** (`three-tier-be`)
   - SonarQube analysis → Trivy scan → Docker build → ECR push
   - Date-based image tags (YYYYMMDD-BUILD)
   - ArgoCD Image Updater auto-deploys new images

3. **Infrastructure-Validation-MBP** (infrastructure repo)
   - Terraform validation → K8s YAML validation → Shell script validation → Security scan
   - Validates IaC, manifests, ArgoCD configs, scripts
   - No image builds (validation-only pipeline)

**Four ArgoCD Applications:**
1. `frontend` → Deploys from `three-tier-fe/manifests/`
2. `backend` → Deploys from `three-tier-be/manifests/`
3. `database` → Deploys from infrastructure `k8s-infrastructure/Database/`
4. `ingress` → Deploys from infrastructure `k8s-infrastructure/ingress.yaml`

**GitOps Workflow:**
```
Developer Push → GitHub Webhook → Jenkins MBP → Build & Push to ECR
                                                       ↓
                                              ArgoCD Image Updater
                                              Monitors ECR for new tags
                                                       ↓
                                              Directly updates deployments
                                                       ↓
                                              ArgoCD sync → Deploy to EKS
```

**Lessons Learned from Complete Migration:**
- Phased approach reduces risk and validates each step
- Independent repositories enable true microservices development
- Consistent manifest structure (`manifests/`) improves maintainability
- Shared infrastructure (database, ingress) should remain centralized
- Date-based tagging (YYYYMMDD-BUILD) provides better versioning than sequential numbers
- ArgoCD applications work excellently for both microservices and shared resources
- Infrastructure validation pipeline catches errors before production
- Removing sudo dependencies makes pipelines more secure and portable

**Impact:**
- 🎯 **100% Microservices Decoupling:** Complete separation achieved
- 🚀 **3 Independent CI/CD Pipelines:** Each with specific purpose
- 📦 **Clean Repository Structure:** Application code separated from infrastructure
- ✅ **Zero Downtime Migration:** Seamless transition without service interruption
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security:** Automated validation and security scanning
- 📊 **Better Developer Experience:** Teams can work independently without conflicts

### 6. 📦 ECR Lifecycle Policy for Automated Image Cleanup
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Completion Date:** November 20, 2025

**Description:**
Implemented automated cleanup of untagged Docker images (cache layers) to reduce ECR storage costs while preserving all production images.

**Problem:** ECR repositories contained 70-90% untagged images (Docker BuildKit cache layers from multi-stage builds), consuming unnecessary storage and incurring costs (~$0.10/GB-month).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  ✅ **Created Terraform ECR Repository Definitions:** Added `ecr_repositories.tf` with resource definitions for frontend and backend ECR repositories
    - Configured: `image_tag_mutability = MUTABLE`, `scan_on_push = true`, `encryption_type = AES256`
    - Added outputs for repository URLs and ARNs
2.  ✅ **Implemented Lifecycle Policies:** Created `ecr_lifecycle_policies.tf` with 2-rule policy structure:
    - **Rule 1 (Priority 1):** Keep all tagged images indefinitely (prefix "20", count 9999)
    - **Rule 2 (Priority 2):** Delete untagged images older than 5 days
3.  ✅ **Imported Existing Repositories:** Created `import-ecr.sh` script to import manually-created ECR repos into Terraform state
    - Script checks repository existence before import
    - Imports both frontend and backend repositories
    - Includes var-file parameter for Terraform variables
4.  ✅ **Applied Policies via Terraform:** Successfully applied lifecycle policies to both repositories using Terraform
5.  ✅ **Version Control:** All ECR infrastructure now managed as Infrastructure as Code

**Expected Benefits:**
- 💰 **Cost Savings:** $1-2/month per repository (~70-90% storage reduction)
- 🗑️ **Automated Cleanup:** Untagged images automatically deleted after 5 days
- ✅ **Production Safety:** All tagged images (YYYYMMDD-BUILD format) preserved indefinitely
- 📋 **Version Control:** ECR infrastructure managed through Terraform

**Files Created:**
- `Jenkins-Server-TF/ecr_repositories.tf` (ECR resource definitions)
- `Jenkins-Server-TF/ecr_lifecycle_policies.tf` (Lifecycle policy management)
- `Jenkins-Server-TF/ecr-lifecycle-policy.json` (Standalone JSON version)
- `Jenkins-Server-TF/import-ecr.sh` (Import automation script)

### 8. 📋 IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
**Status:** 🚀 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Timeline:** Future (Deferred)  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Description:**
Replace IMDSv1 metadata access with proper IRSA for ALB Ingress Controller and other workloads.

**Current Issue:**
- Nodes configured with IMDSv1 "optional" (less secure)
- ALB controller accesses EC2 metadata for VPC/subnet info
- Security vulnerability - any pod can access node metadata

**Implementation:**
1. Create IAM OIDC provider for EKS cluster
2. Create IAM role for ALB controller with trust policy
3. Attach AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy
4. Update ALB controller ServiceAccount with role annotation
5. Remove node metadata workaround (set IMDSv2 to required)

**Benefits:**
- 🔒 Enhanced security (principle of least privilege)
- ✅ No metadata access workarounds
- ✅ Proper AWS permissions model
- ✅ Audit trail for AWS API calls
- ✅ Production-grade configuration

**Reference:** POST-SHUTDOWN-RECOVERY-CHECKLIST.md - Architecture Recommendation #7

### 6. 📋 Jenkins Pipeline Enhancements
**Status:** 🚀 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Timeline:** Q2 2026  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

**Description:**
Enhance Jenkins pipelines with parallel execution, automated rollback, advanced security scanning, and notifications.

#### **6.1 Parallel Execution Optimization**

**Current Flow (Sequential):**
```
Checkout → SonarQube → Trivy FS → Docker Build → ECR Push → Trivy Image
Total Time: ~6-8 minutes
```

**Optimized Flow (Parallel):**
```groovy
stage('Parallel Security Scans') {
    parallel {
        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps { /* Code quality */ }
        }
        stage('Trivy FS Scan') {
            steps { /* Filesystem vulnerabilities */ }
        }
        stage('OWASP Dependency Check') {
            steps { /* Dependency vulnerabilities */ }
        }
        stage('Git Secrets Scan') {
            steps { /* Credential scanning */ }
        }
    }
}

stage('Build & Scan Image') {
    parallel {
        stage('Docker Build & Push') {
            stages {
                stage('Build') { /* ... */ }
                stage('Push to ECR') { /* ... */ }
            }
        }
        stage('Run Unit Tests') {
            steps { /* Parallel testing */ }
        }
    }
}
```

**Expected Time Savings:** 30-40% reduction (5-6 minutes total)

#### **6.2 Automated Rollback Mechanism**

```groovy
stage('Deploy & Verify') {
    steps {
        script {
            def previousImage = sh(
                script: "kubectl get deployment api -n three-tier -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'",
                returnStdout: true
            ).trim()
            
            try {
                // Deploy new version
                sh "kubectl set image deployment/api api=${NEW_IMAGE} -n three-tier"
                
                // Wait for rollout (5 minute timeout)
                sh "kubectl rollout status deployment/api -n three-tier --timeout=5m"
                
                // Health check with retries
                def healthCheck = false
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    sleep 10
                    healthCheck = sh(
                        script: "curl -f http://${SERVICE_URL}/healthz",
                        returnStatus: true
                    ) == 0
                    if (healthCheck) break
                }
                
                if (!healthCheck) {
                    throw new Exception("Health check failed after 5 retries")
                }
                
                // Smoke tests
                sh "./run-smoke-tests.sh"
                
                echo "✅ Deployment successful and verified"
                
            } catch (Exception e) {
                echo "❌ Deployment failed! Rolling back to ${previousImage}"
                sh "kubectl set image deployment/api api=${previousImage} -n three-tier"
                sh "kubectl rollout status deployment/api -n three-tier --timeout=3m"
                error("Deployment failed and rolled back: ${e.message}")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

  namespace: three-tier
spec:
  serviceName: mongodb-svc
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:4.4
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongodb-storage
          mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mongodb-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]

# Start SonarQube
docker start sonar

# Cleanup old backups (keep last 7 days)
aws s3 ls "$S3_BUCKET/" | grep "sonarqube-backup" | \
    sort -r | tail -n +8 | awk '{print $4}' | \
    xargs -I {} aws s3 rm "$S3_BUCKET/{}" --recursive

# Remove local backup
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR"
```

**Cron Schedule:**
```bash
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /opt/backup-sonarqube.sh >> /var/log/sonarqube-backup.log 2>&1
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automated daily backups
- ✅ Off-site storage (S3)

## Automation & Operational Improvements

### 13. ✅ S3 Backup Integration for Cluster Configuration
**Status:** ✅ **Completed** (November 19, 2025)  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Timeline:** Completed  
**Implementation Time:** 2 hours

**Description:**
Enhanced the shutdown and startup scripts with S3 backup integration to prevent data loss during cluster recovery operations. This addresses the critical issue of accidentally deleted local backup files.

#### **Problem Statement:**
During a cluster recovery operation, the local backup file created during shutdown was accidentally deleted, requiring a complete manual reconstruction of the cluster configuration from AWS Console. This highlighted the need for durable, off-site backup storage.

#### **Solution Implemented:**

**1. Shutdown Script (`shutdown-cluster.sh`) Enhancements:**
- Added S3 configuration variables:
  ```bash
  S3_BUCKET="three-tier-k8s-backups"
  S3_BACKUP_KEY="backups/cluster-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz"
  ```
- Added **Step 7: Upload Backup to S3**
  - Compresses backup directory to `.tar.gz` format for efficient storage
  - Uploads to S3 with timestamp-based naming: `cluster-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz`
  - Creates `latest-backup.txt` reference file for easy retrieval
  - Updated summary output to display S3 upload status
  - Includes error handling and verification

**2. Startup Script (`startup-cluster.sh`) Enhancements:**
- Added S3 configuration variables:
  ```bash
  S3_BUCKET="three-tier-k8s-backups"
  BACKUP_DIR=""
  ```
- Added **Step 2: Download Backup from S3**
  - Smart fallback logic:
    1. First checks for local backup directory
    2. If not found, downloads latest backup from S3
    3. Falls back to manual configuration if no backup available
  - Downloads latest backup using `latest-backup.txt` reference
  - Secondary fallback: Lists all backups and downloads most recent
  - Extracts `.tar.gz` backup automatically
  - Continues with existing recovery workflow
- Renumbered all subsequent steps (3-11) to maintain proper sequence

**3. S3 Bucket Configuration:**
- Created bucket: `three-tier-k8s-backups`
- Enabled versioning for backup history
- Configured lifecycle policy:
  - Transition to Glacier after 30 days
  - Delete after 90 days
  - Reduces storage costs while maintaining recovery window

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Smart Fallback Logic:**
   - Prioritizes local backups for speed
   - Automatically downloads from S3 if local backup missing
   - Gracefully handles scenarios with no backup available

2. **Efficient Storage:**
   - Compression reduces storage costs and transfer time
   - Timestamp-based naming for version tracking
   - Latest reference file for quick access

3. **Durability:**
   - S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability
   - Versioning protects against accidental overwrites
   - Geographic redundancy included

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Comprehensive error checking at each step
   - Continues with manual configuration if download fails
   - Clear status messages for troubleshooting

#### **Technical Implementation:**

**Shutdown Script - S3 Upload Logic:**
```bash
################################################################################
# Step 7: Upload Backup to S3
################################################################################
print_header "Step 7: Uploading Backup to S3"

if [[ -n "$BACKUP_DIR" && -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]]; then
    echo "Compressing backup directory..."
    BACKUP_ARCHIVE="${BACKUP_DIR}.tar.gz"
    tar -czf "$BACKUP_ARCHIVE" "$BACKUP_DIR" || {
        print_error "Failed to compress backup directory"
    }
    
    if [[ -f "$BACKUP_ARCHIVE" ]]; then
        echo "Uploading backup to S3: s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${S3_BACKUP_KEY}"
        aws s3 cp "$BACKUP_ARCHIVE" "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${S3_BACKUP_KEY}" --region "$REGION" || {
            print_warning "Failed to upload backup to S3. Local backup preserved at: $BACKUP_ARCHIVE"
        }
        
        # Update latest backup reference
        echo "$S3_BACKUP_KEY" | aws s3 cp - "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/backups/latest-backup.txt" --region "$REGION"
        
        print_success "Backup uploaded to S3: s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${S3_BACKUP_KEY}"
        
        # Optional: Remove local compressed backup to save space
        rm -f "$BACKUP_ARCHIVE"
    fi
else
    print_warning "No backup directory found to upload to S3"
fi
```

**Startup Script - S3 Download Logic:**
```bash
################################################################################
# Step 2: Download Backup from S3 (if not available locally)
################################################################################
print_header "Step 2: Checking for Backup Configuration"

# Check if local backup exists
LOCAL_BACKUP=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "cluster-backup-*" | head -1)

if [[ -n "$LOCAL_BACKUP" && -d "$LOCAL_BACKUP" ]]; then
    print_success "Found local backup: $LOCAL_BACKUP"
    BACKUP_DIR="$LOCAL_BACKUP"
else
    print_warning "No local backup found. Attempting to download from S3..."
    
    # Get the latest backup from S3
    LATEST_BACKUP_KEY=$(aws s3 cp "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/backups/latest-backup.txt" - --region "$REGION")
    
    if [[ -z "$LATEST_BACKUP_KEY" ]]; then
        print_warning "No backup reference found in S3. Checking for latest backup..."
        LATEST_BACKUP_KEY=$(aws s3 ls "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/backups/" | grep "cluster-backup-" | sort -r | head -1 | awk '{print $4}')
    fi
    
    if [[ -n "$LATEST_BACKUP_KEY" ]]; then
        echo "Downloading backup from S3: s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${LATEST_BACKUP_KEY}"
        
        # Download and extract
        TEMP_BACKUP="/tmp/$(basename $LATEST_BACKUP_KEY)"
        aws s3 cp "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${LATEST_BACKUP_KEY}" "$TEMP_BACKUP" --region "$REGION"
        
        echo "Extracting backup..."
        tar -xzf "$TEMP_BACKUP" -C "."
        
        BACKUP_DIR=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "cluster-backup-*" | head -1)
        print_success "Backup downloaded and extracted: $BACKUP_DIR"
        
        rm -f "$TEMP_BACKUP"
    else
        print_warning "No backup found in S3. Will proceed with manual configuration."
        BACKUP_DIR=""
    fi
fi
```

## Security Enhancements

### 18. 🔐 AWS Secrets Manager & External Secrets Operator
**Status:** 🚀 Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Timeline:** Future (Post-MVP)  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

#### **Current State (MVP Approach):**
The application currently uses **Kubernetes base64-encoded Secrets** for sensitive data (MongoDB credentials). While this approach works for development and MVP, it has security limitations:

**Current Implementation:**
```yaml
# k8s-infrastructure/Database/secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongodb-secret
  namespace: three-tier
type: Opaque
data:
  MONGO_USERNAME: YWRtaW4=  # base64: admin
  MONGO_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64: password
```

**Known Limitations (Accepted for MVP):**
- ❌ Base64 is **encoding**, not encryption (easily reversible)
- ❌ Secrets visible to anyone with `kubectl` access
- ❌ No audit trail for secret access
- ❌ Manual secret rotation required
- ❌ etcd stores secrets unencrypted by default (unless EKS encryption enabled)

**Why This is Acceptable for MVP:**
- ✅ Focus on **infrastructure and platform** setup first
- ✅ Demonstrates **microservices architecture** and **GitOps workflow**
- ✅ Enables rapid development and testing
- ✅ Cost-effective (no additional AWS services)
- ✅ Sufficient security for non-production, portfolio project
- ✅ **ARNs and Account IDs** in Git are safe (public information)

#### **Future Production-Grade Solution:**

**Architecture: AWS Secrets Manager + External Secrets Operator**

```

#### **Implementation Steps (Future):**

**Phase 1: Setup External Secrets Operator (2-3 hours)**

1. **Install External Secrets Operator:**
```bash
helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
helm install external-secrets \
  external-secrets/external-secrets \
  -n external-secrets-system \
  --create-namespace
```

2. **Create IAM Role with IRSA:**
```bash
# IAM Policy for Secrets Manager access
cat > external-secrets-policy.json <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:*:secret:three-tier/*"
  }]
}
EOF

# Create IAM policy
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name ExternalSecretsPolicy \
  --policy-document file://external-secrets-policy.json

# Create service account with IRSA
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --name external-secrets-sa \
  --namespace three-tier \
  --cluster three-tier-eks \
  --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::296062548155:policy/ExternalSecretsPolicy \
  --approve
```

**Phase 2: Migrate Secrets to AWS Secrets Manager (2-3 hours)**

1. **Create Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager:**
```bash
# MongoDB credentials
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name three-tier/prod/mongodb \
  --secret-string '{"username":"admin","password":"SuperSecure123!@#"}' \
  --region us-east-1

# JWT secret (for future session management)
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name three-tier/prod/jwt-secret \
  --secret-string '{"secret":"your-jwt-secret-256-bits"}' \
  --region us-east-1
```

2. **Create ExternalSecret Resources:**
```yaml
# k8s-infrastructure/Database/external-secret.yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets-manager
  namespace: three-tier
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-east-1
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets-sa
---
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: mongodb-credentials
  namespace: three-tier
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h  # Sync every hour
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secrets-manager
  target:
    name: mongodb-secret  # Creates this K8s Secret
    creationPolicy: Owner
  data:
  - secretKey: MONGO_USERNAME
    remoteRef:
      key: three-tier/prod/mongodb
      property: username
  - secretKey: MONGO_PASSWORD
    remoteRef:
      key: three-tier/prod/mongodb
      property: password
```

3. **Delete Old Secret (from Git):**
```bash
# Remove secrets.yaml from Git and add to .gitignore
git rm k8s-infrastructure/Database/secrets.yaml
echo "secrets.yaml" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "security: Migrate to External Secrets Operator"
```

**Phase 3: Enable Secret Rotation (1-2 hours)**

1. **Setup Lambda for MongoDB Password Rotation:**
```python
# Lambda function rotates MongoDB password
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # 1. Generate new password
    # 2. Update MongoDB user password
    # 3. Update secret in Secrets Manager
    # 4. ExternalSecret syncs to K8s automatically
    pass
```

2. **Configure Rotation Schedule:**
```bash
aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
  --secret-id three-tier/prod/mongodb \
  --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:296062548155:function:MongoDBRotation \
  --rotation-rules AutomaticallyAfterDays=30
```

#### **Benefits of Future Implementation:**

| Aspect | Current (MVP) | Future (Production) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Encryption** | Base64 encoding | AWS KMS encryption |
| **Access Control** | kubectl access | IAM policies |
| **Audit Trail** | None | CloudTrail logs |
| **Rotation** | Manual | Automatic (30 days) |
| **Git Safety** | ⚠️ Must be careful | ✅ Never in Git |
| **Cost** | Free | ~$2-3/month |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **Security Level** | Development | Production-grade |

#### **Cost Estimate (Future Implementation):**
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** $0.40/secret/month + $0.05/10K API calls
- **KMS:** $1/month + $0.03/10K requests
- **Total:** ~$2-3/month for production-grade secrets management

#### **Security Note:**
**What IS Safe in Public Git Repository:**
- ✅ **Certificate ARNs** (e.g., ACM certificate ARN in ingress.yaml)
- ✅ **AWS Account IDs** (not considered sensitive by AWS)
- ✅ **Resource ARNs** (ECR repos, S3 buckets, VPCs, subnets)
- ✅ **Public configuration** (ingress rules, service ports, replicas)

**What MUST Stay Secret:**
- ❌ AWS Access Keys / Secret Keys
- ❌ Database passwords (current: base64 in secrets.yaml)
- ❌ API keys / JWT secrets
- ❌ SSH private keys
- ❌ OAuth client secrets

**Current MVP Decision:** Accept base64 secrets for development/portfolio, migrate to AWS Secrets Manager for production deployment.
